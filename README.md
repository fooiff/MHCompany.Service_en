1. Basic Terms

If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. You shall not use the Services if you are under age 18 without parental consent or have previously been banned from using the Services. If you are under age 18, you represent that you have your parent or guardian’s permission to use the Apps, please have them read these Terms with you. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a user under age 18, you are subject to these Terms and responsible for your child’s activities on the Apps.

  

It is your responsibility to ensure your equipment (computer, laptop, netbook, tablet or other mobile device) meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to access and use the Services.

 

Agreement to Terms

 

By accepting these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms. The Services that MHGames provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time. As a result, we may need to amend these Terms from time to time. That being said, we will provide you with notice of such changes to the Terms through the Services, or through any other appropriate measures as determined by us in our sole discretion. If you continue to use the Services for 30 days after such notice we will take this as you accepting them. If you do not accept the changes, you can terminate your agreement with us within 30 days of receipt of notice of the proposed changes.

 

MHGames may from time to time need to modify or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to Users generally; although MHGames will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to you, MHGames may not be able to provide you with prior notice. If you continue using the Services for 30 days after any such modifications, we will assume you have accepted them (this includes updates). We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.

 

Registration

 

If you want to use certain features of the Services, you need to create an account and become a registered user (“User”). It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information for your account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete, and up to date. If you do not, we may have to suspend or terminate your account. We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason or to disable any log-on ID, at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms or if any details you provide for the purposes of registering as a User prove to be false.

 

You are responsible for safeguarding the password or credentials that you use to access the Services and for any activities or actions under your account. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols) with your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not you know about them. If your account is hacked or any third parties use your account, then you shall immediately notify us and follow our instructions. We may restrict usage of such account in our sole discretion.

 

If you are domiciled in a European Union member country, you may have the right to withdraw from any purchase on the Service without giving any reason. For any digital content purchased online, you have agreed upon checkout that the withdrawal period will expire 14 days after you purchase such digital content or when you start downloading the content for the first time, whichever is sooner. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from the purchase by an unequivocal statement (e.g. by a letter sent to us). Pursuant to European Law, the statutory right of withdrawal is not applicable as regards the following: (i) service contracts after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that s/he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed by the trader; (ii) the supply of goods made to the consumer’s specifications or clearly personalized; (iii) the supply of goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items; (iv) the supply of sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software which were unsealed after delivery; and (v) the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent and his acknowledgment that he thereby loses his right of withdrawal.

 

Our use of your information is subject to our Privacy Policy.

 

Advertisements

 

The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the content or information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for MHGames granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that MHGames and its subsidiary, third party providers, and partners may place such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others, unless otherwise provided.

 

2. Updates

 

We may provide patches, updates, or upgrades to the Services that must be installed for you to continue to use the Services. Although we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you, we may update the Services remotely without notifying you, and apply patches, updates, and upgrades. We may modify, suspend, discontinue, substitute, replace, or limit your access to any aspect of the Services at any time. You acknowledge that your use of the Services does not confer on you any interest, monetary or otherwise, in any aspect or feature of the Services, including but not limited to (where applicable) any rewards, or Content (save for where it is your own User Content). You also acknowledge that any data, customization, or other data related to your use of the Services may cease to be available to you at any time without notice, including without limitation after a patch, update, or upgrade is applied. We do not have any maintenance or support obligations with respect to the Services.

 

3. App Currency and Content

 

We may offer you the ability to acquire licenses to in-app currency (“App Currency”) or Content, such as by: (a) purchasing a limited license to use App Currency for a fee (“Purchased App Currency”), (b) earning a limited license to use App Currency by performing or accomplishing specific tasks in the Services, or (c) purchasing for a fee, exchanging App Currency for, or earning a limited license to use Content.

 

When you earn or pay the fee to obtain such App Currency or Content, you are obtaining or purchasing from MHGames the right to license such App Currency or Content. Regardless of any references MHGames may make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling App Currency or Content, both App Currency and Content are licensed, not sold, to you under the license. Use of an MHGames account balance to purchase App Currency or Content is subject to these Terms.

 

Neither App Currency nor Content are redeemable for money or monetary value from MHGames or any other person, except as otherwise required by applicable law. App Currency and Content do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency. Neither MHGames nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange App Currency or Content for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency. You agree that MHGames may engage in actions that may impact the perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of App Currency and Content at any time, except as prohibited by applicable law.

 

If you are domiciled in the United Kingdom or European Union, your right of cancellation is waived if: (i) you grant express consent and acknowledge that (ii) such right to cancel will be lost.

 

You expressly consent that the supply of Purchased App Currency and Content will begin immediately upon your purchase and you acknowledge that that your right to cancel the purchase contract will be lost.  All purchases of Purchased App Currency and Content are final and are not refundable, transferable, or exchangeable under any circumstances, except as otherwise required by applicable law. MHGames, in its sole discretion, may impose limits on the amount of App Currency or Content that may be purchased, earned, accumulated, redeemed, or otherwise used.

 

Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, MHGames, in its sole discretion, has the absolute right to manage, modify, substitute, replace, suspend, cancel or eliminate App Currency or Content, including your ability to access or use App Currency or Content, without notice or liability to you. You may not transfer, sell, gift, exchange, trade, lease, sublicense, or rent App Currency or Content except within the Services and as expressly permitted by MHGames.

 

Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law or these Terms, MHGames reserves and retains all rights, title, and interest, property or otherwise, in and to the App Currency and Content. The license to App Currency and Content under the license will terminate upon termination of the license and as otherwise provided herein.

 

When you provide payment information to MHGames or its authorized processor, you represent that you are an authorized user of the payment card, PIN, key, account or other payment method specified by you, and you authorize MHGames to charge such payment method for the full amount of the transaction. If you are a minor, you must obtain a parent or legal guardian’s permission prior to entering or using any payment methods.

 

We do our best to describe every product or service offered on the Service as accurately as possible. However, we do not warrant that any part of the Services, including without limitation the product specifications, pricing, or other Content on the Services is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, MHGames shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion unless applicable laws dictate otherwise. If we charged your credit card or other account prior to our cancellation, we would issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge. Additional terms may apply, and you will have the opportunity to review such terms in such cases. If a product or service you purchased from us is not as described, your sole remedy is to cancel the purchase and receive a credit for the purchase price.

11. Dispute Resolution

 

Governing Law

 

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, however nothing in these Terms shall deprive you of any mandatory protections available to you under your local law.

 

Agreement to Arbitrate

 

Unless you are a User located in the United Kingdom or European Union:

 

You and MHGames agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, or the use of the Services or Content (all together, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court (a “Small Claims Action”) and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (an “IP Protection Action”). You agree you may bring arbitration claims only on your own behalf and not on behalf of any other person or entity.

 

Unless you timely provide MHGames with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the subsection titled “Your Choices”), you acknowledge and agree that you and MHGames are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and MHGames otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

 

This clause does not limit either party’s ability to file an action in a court with jurisdiction to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for disputes relating to intellectual property, proprietary data or to enforce this dispute resolution clause, including your agreement not to assert claims related to the suspension or termination of another person’s account. In any such action, the court rather than an arbitrator must decide whether such a claim is arbitrable and must decide whether the party is entitled to the requested injunctive or other equitable relief.

 

Arbitration Rules

 

The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) in the United States then in effect, except as modified by this Section 11. (The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/mediation or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 11. This arbitration section is drafted for the United States. If you are domiciled outside of the United States, except where this arbitration section is not applicable, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“ICDR”) rules shall apply.

 

Arbitration Process

 

A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the applicable rules. (The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

 

Arbitration Location and Procedure

 

Unless you and MHGames otherwise agree, in the United States, the arbitration will be conducted in the state where you reside, with the option for you to participate telephonically to the extent the AAA Rules allow. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and MHGames submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

 

Arbitrator’s Decision

 

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions which the arbitrator based its award on. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the arbitration award. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” subsection of Section 10 above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. MHGames will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration, unless such arbitration is found by the arbitrator to be frivolous under the standards of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11(b) and in that case MHGames shall be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees in addition to any damages awarded to it.

 

Fees

 

If the arbitrator finds that your payment of the administrative and arbitrator fees (excluding any attorney’s fees) under this subsection is a burden on you, we agree to pay those fees for you (but not any attorney’s fees).

 

Changes

 

By rejecting any changes to these Terms in accordance with Section 1, unless you are a User situated in the United Kingdom, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and MHGames in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11 as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

 

Your Choices

 

Unless you are located in the United Kingdom, European Union, or other jurisdiction where this provision is not enforceable, if you don’t want to settle Disputes by arbitration as described above, you will notify MHGames by submitting a written notice to fooiff@thetutor.co.kr. telling us that you don’t want to use arbitration, within thirty (30) days of the date on which you agreed to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). For Users who submit an Arbitration Opt-out Notice or for User situated in the United Kingdom, European Union, or other jurisdiction where this provision is not enforceable, you agree that all Disputes will be resolved exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in in your jurisdiction of residence. Unless you are situated in the United Kingdom, European Union, or other jurisdiction where this provision is not enforceable, if you don’t provide MHGames with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the 30 day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except for a Small Claims Action and an IP Protection Action as stated above.
